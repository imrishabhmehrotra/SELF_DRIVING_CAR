#Self Driving Car
It is a JavaScript project that implements a self-driving car simulation using only native JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries. This project aims to showcase the principles of autonomous vehicle control and navigation through a simple and interactive web-based simulation.

Features
Pure JavaScript: This project is developed entirely in JavaScript, demonstrating the core concepts of self-driving car algorithms without depending on any external libraries.

Canvas-based Simulation: The car simulation is rendered using the HTML5 Canvas element, providing a visually engaging environment for the self-driving car to navigate.

Basic Autonomous Control: The self-driving car is equipped with basic autonomous control algorithms derived from neural networks.
